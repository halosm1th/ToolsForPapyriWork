# Papyri DB Verification

## Description

The project focuses on improving the Papyri.info Checklist, which includes editions of Greek, Latin, Demotic, and Coptic texts. The current checklist is a critical data store utilized with abbreviations but faces challenges due to its static nature and its storage within a GitHub repository. The site currently hosts a markdown document (checklist.md), making it difficult to search and dynamically update.

  ```bash
  cd '.\Papryi Checklist Items Exist in DB Verification\'
  ```
